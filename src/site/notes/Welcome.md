## My Personal Journey:
I am on a journey to be a better human being, continuously exploring the mechanisms of the universe, understanding humanity, and reflecting on the existence of all things around me. I am particularly focused on how to avoid wrong paths and trying to understand life’s deeper truths. I am actively seeking ways to ‘hack the system’ in the most positive and productive way.

Through it all, the flag that I aim to capture is **"Life, is the name of following Prophet Muhammad (SAW)"**.
