Time is short; seek the truth, strive for Allah's pleasure, and live life according to His commands. Focus on learning skills, acquiring knowledge, improving your health, solving problems, engaging in Dawah, and maintaining a good diet. All other fears are distractions meant to hold you back. Rise and donâ€™t be lazy.
